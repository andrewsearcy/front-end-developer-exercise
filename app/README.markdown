//the functions created for each AJAX callback produce the JSON response of 'friends'

//I then used a for loop to loop through the array(s) to find the number based on what was clicked.

//the strings that were given were then printed to the DOM in each section based on the friends.babysteps.

//I attempted to replicate the page with my own transition affects, however I ran out of time 
    in completing the styling as well as fixing step six and seven call back DOM renders.

//Click the icon boxes to see the array callbacks.

//I used the hover method rather than Javascript to produce the content description for each Baby Step.

//LOVED THE CHALLENGE!
